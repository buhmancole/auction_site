## Alpha Auction Project Plan

#### Project Overview
This project aims to build a system for running an auction at a school or church activity.
The auction system will be for managing a live event, not running an online auction like e-bay. It aims to replace paper voting with a mobile phone system so that people can know what they’ve spent so far and will also help tally the results at the end of the night. The system will support both a silent auction and a live auction and be capable of running on a PC (for an administrator) and iOS and Android mobile devices.

#### Team Organization
Cole - Front End - UI Implementation
Laurel - Front End - Overall UI design / implementation
Jaden - Back End - database
Avery - Back End - resident gopher
Kai - project lead / resident tester

All team members are expected to adhere to egoless programming. All changes must be reviewed by another team member, with the expectation that reviews are professional and avoid use of personaliezed language. The creation and use of unit testing is expected from all team members. For a visualization of team structure, see the included diagram named TeamStructureDiagram.

#### Software Development Process
The development will be broken up into five phases.  Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized.   Then, using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address.  The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a retrospective.

Phase	Iteration
1.	Phase 1 - Requirements Capture
2.	Phase 2 - Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design
3	Phase 3 - Implementation, and Unit Testing
4	Phase 4 - More Implementation and Testing 

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component interactions, and behaviors.
