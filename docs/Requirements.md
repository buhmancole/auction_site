## Alpha Auction Requirements

#### 1.	Introduction and Context
This project aims to build a system for running an auction at a school or church activity.
The auction system will be for managing a live event, not running an online auction like e-bay. It aims to replace paper voting with a mobile phone system so that people can know what theyâ€™ve spent so far and will also help tally the results at the end of the night. The system will support both a silent auction and a live auction and be capable of running on a PC (for an administrator) and iOS and Android mobile devices.
